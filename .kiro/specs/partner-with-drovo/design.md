# Design Document

## Overview

The Partner with Drovo section will be a clean, professional section positioned strategically on the homepage to attract restaurant partners. It will feature a simple two-column layout on desktop with key benefits and a clear call-to-action, maintaining visual consistency with the existing homepage design.

## Architecture

The section will be implemented as a self-contained component within the Home.jsx file, following the existing pattern of other homepage sections. It will use CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout and minimal CSS animations for subtle visual enhancement.

## Components and Interfaces

### Partner Section Structure
```jsx
<section className="partner-section">
  <div className="partner-container">
    <div className="partner-content">
      <div className="partner-text">
        <h2>Partner with Drovo</h2>
        <p>Join thousands of restaurants growing their business with Drovo</p>
        <ul className="partner-benefits">
          <li>Reach more customers</li>
          <li>Increase your revenue</li>
          <li>Easy order management</li>
          <li>Marketing support</li>
        </ul>
        <button className="partner-cta-btn">Become a Partner</button>
      </div>
      <div className="partner-visual">
        <div className="partner-image-placeholder">
          {/* Simple illustration or image */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

### CSS Design Approach
- Clean, minimal design with subtle shadows and borders
- Consistent color scheme matching existing homepage sections
- Simple hover effects on buttons and benefit items
- Responsive grid layout that stacks on mobile
- No heavy animations - only subtle transitions

## Data Models

No complex data models required. Static content will be hardcoded in the component with the following structure:

```javascript
const partnerBenefits = [
  "Reach more customers in your area",
  "Increase revenue with online orders", 
  "Easy-to-use restaurant dashboard",
  "Dedicated marketing support"
];
```

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if partner CTA button fails to navigate
- Responsive design ensures content remains accessible on all screen sizes
- No external API calls, so minimal error scenarios

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test component renders correctly
- Test responsive behavior at different breakpoints
- Test button click handlers

### Integration Testing  
- Verify section integrates properly with existing homepage
- Test navigation flow from partner CTA button
- Validate accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Visual Testing
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness validation
- Performance testing to ensure fast loading

## Implementation Notes

- Position the section after the testimonials/stats section
- Use existing CSS variables for colors and spacing consistency
- Implement with semantic HTML for accessibility
- Keep animations minimal - only subtle hover effects and transitions
- Ensure the section doesn't impact existing homepage performance
