# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the home page hero section by replacing the single "Explore Now" call-to-action button with two distinct buttons that provide users with clearer navigation options. The first button will focus on search functionality, while the second will encourage user engagement with the platform through a "Join Drovo" action.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the home page, I want to see two distinct action buttons instead of one generic "Explore Now" button, so that I can choose between searching for shops or joining the Drovo platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the hero section THEN the system SHALL display two buttons side by side instead of the single "Explore Now" button
2. WHEN a user views the buttons THEN the system SHALL show a "Search" button as the primary action
3. WHEN a user views the buttons THEN the system SHALL show a "Join Drovo" button as the secondary action

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the "Search" button to help me find shops based on my location, so that I can quickly access relevant nearby options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Search" button THEN the system SHALL scroll to the shops section
2. IF the user has not entered a location THEN the system SHALL highlight or focus the location input field
3. WHEN the user has already entered a location THEN the system SHALL scroll directly to the filtered shop results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the "Join Drovo" button to help me get started with the platform, so that I can easily access registration or onboarding features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Join Drovo" button THEN the system SHALL scroll to the shops section to showcase available options
2. WHEN the "Join Drovo" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL display all shops to demonstrate platform value
3. WHEN displaying shops after "Join Drovo" click THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing shop card layout and functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the two buttons to have appropriate visual styling that maintains the existing design consistency, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling with the existing design system
2. WHEN the buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the "Search" button with primary styling (existing cta-button style)
3. WHEN the buttons are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the "Join Drovo" button with secondary styling that complements the primary button
4. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL ensure both buttons remain accessible and properly sized
